# TODO - TASK 3
# Clause coverage. (7 points)
# Create a test suite that achieves clause coverage for a selection of 7 clauses of
# your choice. That is, for each clause c ensure there is a test that sets it to true
# and one that sets it to false. Why did you choose these 7 clauses? Does your
# test suite for clause coverage subsume predicate coverage?
