# TODO - TASK 4:
# Test suite for inactive clause coverage. (4 points)
# Identify 2 inactive clauses i.e. a clause c and a valuation f of the clauses in for
# a particular predicate such that if the truth value of c is changed while retain-
# ing the truth value of the other clauses, then the truth value of the predicate
# does not change. Create a test suite that achieves Restricted Inactive Clause
# Coverage for the two inactive clauses that you have identified.
# Why do your two test suites differ? Can you explain how your test suites
# achieve the targeted coverage?
